Regression Metadata
================

How to fill this metadata file, after you fitted the model explained in
the README file, in the Regression metadata add the following between
the bracket:

In P1 add the name of the person who took the data, in P2, the number of
sites you sampled. In P3, your dependent variable, in P4 the intercept
of your linear model, in P5 the slope of your model, and in P6 the code
of your linear model.

an example of the first two parameters might look like this:

    params:
      P1: [Derek Corcoran]
      P2: [154]
